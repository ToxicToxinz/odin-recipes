            <ul>
                <li>Large sweet potato: Sweet potato adds color, flavor, and moisture to the rolls.</li>
                <li>Whole milk: Used to cook the sweet potatoes.</li>
                <li>Warm water: Warm, not hot, water is key for a good rise.</li>
                <li>Active dry yeast: Helps give the rolls their rise.</li>
                <li>Granulated sugar: Balances the flavor of the dough and keeps the yeast active.</li>
                <li>Large eggs: Binds and adds volume to the dough.</li>
                <li>Butter: Melted to add richness to the rolls and the topping.</li>
                <li>Bread flour: High protein content means feathery but hearty rolls.</li>
                <li>Kosher salt: Enhances the overall flavor.</li>
                <li>Cane syrup: Combined with butter to brush over the tops of the rolls for a sweet touch.</li>
                <li>Flaky sea salt: A hint of salt to finish takes these rolls to the next level.</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredients – flour, salt, sugar, and yeast.</li>
                <li>Warm the milk and water and add them to the dry ingredients. Make sure the liquids are not too hot; they should 
                    be around the same temperature as your body. Too hot, and it might kill the yeast.</li>
                <li>Melt the butter and beat the egg. These should be added to your mixture and everything should be well combined.</li>
                <li>This mixture should be kneaded until it forms a soft yet sturdy dough.</li>
                <li>Cover the dough and let it rise for about an hour or until it has doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Cover the dough and let it rise for about an hour or until it has doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Let them rise again for another 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C. Once it’s ready, you can place your rolls in there to bake for about 20-25 minutes or until they turn a tantalizing golden brown.</li>
