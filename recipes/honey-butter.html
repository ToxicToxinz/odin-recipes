        <ul>
            <li>One stick of unsalted butter (4 ounces or 8 tablespoons), softened</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>For garnish: Drizzle of honey, and a sprinkle of flaky sea salt or kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup (or other small, shatter-proof mixing bowl with tall sides), combine 
                the softened butter, honey, cinnamon and salt. </li>
            <li>Using a hand mixer, whip the ingredients together until the butter is light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to a small serving bowl. Lightly drizzle honey on top, followed by a little sprinkle of flaky salt or kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Serve promptly, or refrigerate for later (let the mixture come back to room temperature before serving). 
                Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
